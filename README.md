## Local Development
1. Clone this repository
2. `cd GuessTheLocation`
3. `cd server && npm i` to install dependencies for the server directory
   1. Note: npx db-migrate up --config database/database.json to set up database ---- ps is this still the necessary step as it gives me error msg and I finished setup without using it
4. `npm run dev`. You should get message `Server listening on 3001`
5. Open a new terminal and run `cd GuessTheLocation/client`
6. Run `npm i` to install dependencies for the client directory
7. `npm start`
8. Navigate to `localhost:3000`, you should see "Hello from server!" message displayed
   1. Note: you should also see the message when navigating to `localhost:3001/api`


## Making Changes
1. Always create a new branch
2. Start both the client and server (see instructions above)
3. Simply save your changes and see them displayed on localhost:3000
